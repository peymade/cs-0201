## Complexity

### Defining It

Some problems are easier or harder, solutions are better or worse
Always try to make it faster.

As the problem gets bigger, how much longer does it take to solve?
Is the time it takes dependent on the size of a given variable?

0(n) == Linear Time
The complexity is dependent on the size of n

This example skips the looping, and treats the continual adding like the calculation of a triangle.
``def add_sumto_C(x): return (x*(x+1))//2``

### Big-O

Searchig for the biggest polynomial or term.

``g(x) = x^3 + e^3x + 192x^2.5``

In this example, e^3x is exponential, so that wins out.

There is so much we don't know hidden in code: how much does it actually cost to create a new list?
Big-O gives timelessness, it is all about proportionality, do it doesn't so much matter how fast an individual computer or software is.

### Common Complexities

- O(1) --> constant time
- O(n) --> linear time  --> loop over all elements
- O(x^2) --> quadratic time --> looping over paired elements (nested loops?)
- O(log x) --> (guessing game)
- O(xlog x) --> (sorting)
