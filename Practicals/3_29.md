## ArrayList

### Defining It

Arraylists are great stacks, not great queues.
Queue = removing from front, new requests go in back
For a queue, better to use LinkedList
PriorityQueue must have a compareTo method

set = changing at a set index
add(T)

``ListADT<String> ys = new ArrayList<>();``
``List<String> ys = new Arraylist<>();``

Adding to the back is cheap, front is linear O(n)

### FixedSizeList

#### Time Complexity of operations

Ideal

- size() -> O(1)
- get(index) -> O(1)
- removeBack -> O(1)
- addBack -> O(1) until space exhausted

Not ideal...

- removeIndex -> O(n)
- removeFront() -> O(n)
- addFront(); addIndex(0,x) -> O(n)

#### Resizing
