## ArrayList

### Defining It

Arraylists are great stacks, not great queues.
Queue = removing from front, new requests go in back
For a queue, better to use LinkedList
PriorityQueue must have a compareTo method

set = changing at a set index
add(T)

``ListADT<String> ys = new ArrayList<>();``
``List<String> ys = new Arraylist<>();``

Adding to the back is cheap, front is linear O(n)

### FixedSizeList

#### Time Complexity of operations

Ideal

- size() -> O(1)
- get(index) -> O(1)
- removeBack -> O(1)
- addBack -> O(1) until space exhausted

Not ideal...

- removeIndex -> O(n)
- removeFront() -> O(n)
- addFront(); addIndex(0,x) -> O(n)

#### Resizing

Steps in resizing a list, when you run out of space? Make a bigger place, copy, and hold onto it.
When resizing, remember something like ``this.array = bigger`` One needs to point to the new array.

You have to slide things out of the way before you can add something in its place. Loop backwards. Such as, when a group of people are in a booth and in order to get a new one in, those in the "back" have to slide out first.

Ideal

- size() -> O(1)
- get(index) -> O(1)
- removeBack -> O(1)
- addBack -> O(1) except when it is O(n), which is rare

Not ideal...

- removeIndex -> O(n)
- removeFront() -> O(n)
- addFront() -> O(n)
- Put in many, then remove them and remain at a low space usage. Wasted space is not efficient.
