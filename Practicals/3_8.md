## Maps and Dictionaries

### Terminology

Items

- (set, list, array): values
- (map) -> this means (key, value) pair

Values

- (set, list, array) this means the items in the collection
- In java, can be described as entries

Typical counting with dictionaries 
``def count_items(items: list) -< dict:
counts = {}
for it in itemsif it in counts:
counts [it] = counts[it] + 1
else:
counts[it] = 1
return counts``
