## Hash Maps

### Defining It

#### Hash Function

A hash is a one-way function, meaning it cannot be inverted. Each specific input has an output, which can be known, but one output could be produced by two inputs.

You can turn strings into hashcodes
Hashing is a huge thing in passowrd. Use OAuth or Facebook login when creating apps to avoid liability.

Compexity of whichBucket is O(length(str)) + O(1) + O(1)
Separate Chaining a LinkedList is O(collisions)
Separate Chaining a Tree is O(log(collisions))

Separate chaining is a way of organizing multiple things in one bucket
Open hashing is linear probing, if there is already something in a bucket, check the next. Potentially dangerous as it is not very random

A LinkedHashMap gives you the ability to deleteFirst, deleteLast, deleteIndex, etc.
